# Task Management Application

This **Task Management Application** is built with **React**. It allows users to manage tasks (add, edit, delete) with task data being stored in **local storage**. Additional features include task searching, filtering, sorting, and pagination.

**Features**

-  **Add, Edit, Delete Tasks**: Users can easily manage tasks via a user-friendly interface.

-  **Search and Filter Tasks**: Tasks can be searched by description and filtered by status.

-  **Sorting**: Tasks can be sorted from newest to oldest or vice versa.

-  **Pagination**: Tasks are paginated with 10 results displayed per page.

-  **Local Storage**: Tasks are persisted in local storage. If no tasks are found, they are loaded from a default dataset.

-  **Status Indication**: Task statuses are color-coded (e.g., "In Progress", "Finished").

**Tech Stack**

-  **React**: Component-based UI library.

-  **React Router**: For managing routing/navigation.

-  **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety across the app.

-  **Radix UI Icons**: Provides clean and consistent icons.

-  **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design.
